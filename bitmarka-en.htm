Instant, commission-free transfers of bitcoins and other crypto-currencies based on the blockbuster.

This megaproject will change the course of the history of mankind and crypto currency will replace the dollar, euro and other currencies. Bitcoin was originally conceived as an unqualified digital currency from anyone, for calculations without limits and anonymous - without verification. But unfortunately all the existing algorithms, formats, software, software, OS, programming languages, zip, gif, png are developed by not very smart and talented people, but random ones that appeared on time in the right place and at the right time or by blat, through communication, and maybe just noodles hung on the employer and he can not be fired after that;) Therefore we have a brake and buggy software, a sea of ​​bugs and vulnerabilities in huge numbers. Another obstacle is the language barrier, this is racism in its pure form, people who do not speak English fluently have unequal conditions in world life, science, etc. Give out all the instantly free AI-text and voice translators and life on earth to change immediately, there will be no wars , no boundaries, progress sharply jerks up, because smart geniuses are full in the world, but they do not know English fluently and do not write in facebook and tweeter. Yes, many sensible people left for Europe, the USA, China, but they are not the very-very, they just learned the language better. And those who teach the language well - more humanities, and not technicians, physicists, mathematicians. Most know at the level I understand with the dictionary, but I can not write and even more so I can not talk. Inequality and inequality are strong because of this.
I have many more ideas of different, in different areas, if someone needs a creator, inventor of digital technologies, reliable formats, write in @ArturPlugin telegrams. I have a new format for images, databases, ideas on how to teach AI and how to improve programming languages. In any areas, I will help to solve the problem in an optimal way and find an unexpected solution. Also I can test any product and point out its shortcomings and how it can be fixed.
It was self-promotion :) Now about the essence in detail.
Article 1. 0% bitcoin commission - real!
How to improve bitcoin (and other crypts), reduce the transfer commission and the time of transfer to zero and make it world currency number one.

The solution lies on the surface, just some are certain that the transfers of bitcoins and so forth can be done only through the block system, but this is not so, the world is multifaceted and one needs to think in different dimensions. There is such a topic: Selling accounts (aki). This is semi-illegal, because many projects prohibit having a lot of aks (wk, fb google, etc.). But nevertheless this business blooms, and brings profit with the right approach. There are also Postage Stamps, you buy them for money, and they already pay for the services of postal transfers of paper letters. We take it all and make Bitcoin-free-coins as brands - briefly Bit-marks. Physically, it's an online bitcoin purse, for example, on a block of money with all its keys, phrases, forks. Theoretically, the balance can be deduced from it in a block, but in fact, at the beginning of 2018 with such commissions and network congestion, small amounts up to $ 1000 are not profitable to deduce, and less than $ 50 is impossible, because the commission is larger, the amount burns simply, or translation is a month, this greatly reduces demand, because not all such rich.

On aka freeze 100 satosh (= 1stosh), it's about a ruble, but you can at least at least 1, but there is no sense. 1000 stash (piece), a million stash (lemon) is the whole bitcoin, it is more convenient than 8 zeros. Running payments in the area of ​​1p-1000r so that it is more convenient to count in the mind without a calculator. These aki have to "bluff" a lot, at first they will be small and they will not be exchanged for 1: 1, but then there will be a lot of them and their price will be equal to the cost of bitcoin. Since the network will be unloaded, the miners will be out of work, cryptofermers will be ruined, and the commission will be zero as originally planned. But transactions will still be longer, so they will rarely be used. Demand will be certain, if now I have 5 bucks on my wallet, and a commission of 50, then if I suddenly blocker. I will offer to change them to Bit-marks for 1%, then I will change them, and thousands of other people will do the same. And bitcoin will come alive and go up again.

How do we all go to Bit-marks? I tell in detail. I need an officer. websites, crypto-currencies, purses, exchanges, exchangers, create bitcoin exchange bitmarking services, they should have them in stock and agree to accept them, ie public recognition is necessary. It is necessary to write to everyone, to tell this idea, to spread this information. So I have not yet found how to write the creator bitcoincheck and ether, in the fb there is a page which is somehow left and a forum which is listless in English. Nobody reads it. We need to develop a common exchange format, open source software, write an official. mobile application and program for PC.

The technology of exchange is detailed. (requires expertise and finalization) The sender has a program on the device - there is an encrypted array of logins and passwords to online purses, with a sum of 100 satosh exactly on each, as these are normal, without confirmation by mail, sms
